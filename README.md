The `Portal Conqueror` is a very basic PoC script that runs a dictionary based
attack on a very primitive captive portal.

There is no cli, the target of the HTML form, the POST data and the error
message used to detect failed attempts are hard coded in the
script. So are values for tried usernames and passwords.
